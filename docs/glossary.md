# Glossary

**API Gateway**  
A MeteoGate Community Component that provides managed access to shared data. It manages data requests and data access flow (e.g., cybersecurity, priority access, request limiting, and rate limiting). The API Gateway also collects transaction data for reporting and usage analysis.

**API Management**  
Technical capability and process for creating and publishing APIs on the web, enforcing their usage policies, controlling access, collecting and analysing usage statistics, and reporting on performance. MeteoGate API Gateway implements API Management in the MeteoGate context.

**API**  
Application Programming Interface – a standardised way for software components or systems to communicate and exchange data.

**Capability Operator (Local and Community)**  
An entity providing and operating infrastructure to allow for data to be discovered and shared. They provide support services and manage access to the services for which they are responsible.

**Community Component**  
MeteoGate infrastructure owned and operated by EUMETNET Members which enables meteorological HVD data to be discovered and shared.

**Computation Service**  
A potential future MeteoGate Community Component enabling users to process data. May be deployed close to data sources and as multiple instances.

**Data Consumer**  
An entity (organisation, individual, or IT application) that consumes data.

**Data Explorer**  
A MeteoGate Community Component that enables users to search and browse data from Data Supply components registered with MeteoGate.

**Data Owner**  
An entity (individual or organisation) which owns the data and defines its usage through rights, obligations, terms, and conditions.

**Data Publisher**  
An entity that shares data with consumers under MeteoGate terms. May also be the Data Owner or act on their behalf.

**Dataset**  
A collection of data with shared characteristics such as type, format, vocabulary, access protocol, quality, or license.

**Data Supply**  
A MeteoGate Local Component for sharing data, managing and publishing metadata, and sending update notifications.

**ECMWF**  
European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts.

**EDR**  
Environmental Data Retrieval – an OGC API standard for accessing environmental data.

**EMI**  
European Meteorological Infrastructure.

**E-SOH**  
EUMETNET Supplementary Observations dataHub – system for sharing high temporal and spatial resolution near real-time observations from land surface weather stations in line with WIS 2.0 and EU regulation on Meteorological High Value Data (HVD).

**EUMETNET**  
A network of 31 European NMHSs.

**EUMETSAT**  
European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites.

**EWC**  
European Weather Cloud – a collaborative cloud platform for meteorological application development and operations, run by ECMWF and EUMETSAT.

**FAIR Principles**  
Widely accepted principles for sharing scientific data: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

**FDCM**  
Federated Data Coordination Mechanism – EUMETNET Programme that defined top-level requirements for MeteoGate.

**FEMDI**  
Federated European Meteo-hydrological Data Infrastructure – the EUMETNET Programme operating MeteoGate.

**Global Discovery Catalogue**  
A WMO Component that indexes metadata records and enables data asset discovery.

**Global Message Broker**  
A WMO Component that provides subscriptions to notifications on metadata and data updates.

**GUI**  
Graphical User Interface – visual interface to interact with information systems.

**HVDs**  
High Value Datasets – EU-defined meteorological datasets including observations, climate, radar, NWP, and warnings.

**HVD Services**  
Centrally operated MeteoGate services for distributing EU High Value Datasets (e.g. Land surface stations (E-SOH), Weather Radar, Climate). *<To be further defined>*

**Identity & Access Manager**  
A MeteoGate Community Component to control user and system access to platforms and platform services. 

**Insights service**  
A MeteoGate Community Component for reporting on data discovery and publication transactions for Data Publishers to derive management information. 

**Local Component**  
MeteoGate infrastructure owned and operated by Data publishers. Data Supply is a typical example of a Local Component. The ORD is a local component of the MeteoGate.

**NMHS**  
National Meteorological and Hydrological Service. Often used interchangeably with ‘NMS’. 

**NMS**  
National Meteorological Service. Often used interchangeably with ‘NMHS’. 

**OGC**  
Open Geospatial Consortium. Develops open API standards for providing and using geospatial data. 

**ORD**
Open Radar Data API service for supplying EUMETNET OPERA wehater radar data and products.

**OSCAR**  
WMO application operated by MeteoSwiss that provides detailed information on observing capabilities, such as automatic weather stations. 

**STAC**
Spatial Temporal Asset Catalogue

**WIS 2.0**  
WMO Information System version 2.0. This provides a framework for WMO data sharing in the 21st century, for all WMO Members and WMO programmes to embrace the Earth system approach, enable the WMO unified data policy, and support the WMO global basic observing network. 

**WMO**  
World Meteorological Org
